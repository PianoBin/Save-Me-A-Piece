# Save-Me-A-Piece
Two big issues which almost all metropolitan and big cities face is the catastrophic food waste problem and the income inequality/poverty rate. Every night loads of cooked and fresh food is thrown out because it did not go for sale the night of or before. Our project “Save me a Piece” looks to eliminate this problem by selling unsold food from restaurants to other non-profit vendors at a discounted rate. A restaurant will be able to post the food they will be selling and non-profits could choose which vendor to purchase from. This way restaurants can get rid of excess food and nonprofits seeking to feed the poor will always have an ample supply.
